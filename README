This project is studying the design and implement the drivers for a virtualized
implementation of infiniband over ethernet.  Initially the focus will be for a
linux-based virtualized Beowulf cluster using KVM.  Our initial goal is to build
a system that allows application, guest-to-guest communication with a message
latency time below native TCP/IP based communication.

This project is designed to contribute a larger study that investigates the use
of off-the-shelf virtualized Beowulf clusters for fine-grained parallel
processing without requiring expensive, high-performance networking hardware.
Our primary studies are with parallel discrete event driven simulation (PDES)
that uses the Time Warp mechanism.  Basically this is a prelude project toward
the construction of a lightweight "virtual appliance/OS" for Time Warp
simulation using standard, low-cost networking hardware.  Our ultimate goal is
to explore techniques for deploying virtualized Beowulf clusters that are shared
across an organization by a collection of users that may have widely varying
computational and messaging requirements.

Please feel free to use and/or contribute to this work.  If you have questions,
ask.  We will try to answer your questions.  This work has been fun for us and
we hope you will find it interesting/useful.  We welcome suggestions and
